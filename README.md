# Registration Form 

Description
This project is a simple **Registration Form** created using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It validates user input in real time and allows registration only when all fields are filled correctly.
The form checks the **name, email, password, and confirm password** fields and shows error messages only after the user interacts with each input.

Features
- Name accepts only alphabet characters  
- Email validation (Gmail format)  
- Password must be at least 6 characters  
- Confirm password must match password  
- Error messages appear only after user interaction  
- Register button enables automatically when all inputs are valid  
- Clean and responsive UI  

Technologies Used
- HTML  
- CSS  
- JavaScript  

How It Works
- User enters details in the registration form  
- JavaScript validates each input on blur and input events  
- Error messages are shown only if the user makes a mistake  
- The Register button remains disabled until all fields are valid  
- On successful validation, an alert message is displayed
